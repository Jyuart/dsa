# Data structures & algorithms

I love data structures & algorithms. And I'd be happy to have more real-time tasks that involve using those. Unfortunately, usually this is not the case.
So, I created this repository to keep learning, trying new stuff, and *showing off occasionally*. It includes small projects created at different periods, probably with different goals in mind: 

 - to help me better understand the topic,
 - visualize something 
 - to write at least somewhat exciting code

Some of the projects (I don't promise this README will be updated), so probably, there'll be more code than descriptions in this list:
- `tree-traversal` - the idea of recursive preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal  
- `pathfinder` - NOT THE SHORTEST, but recursive pathfinder
- `sorting` - initially, I planned to visualize more sorting algorithms, but I failed to decouple the logic from the UI, so I would have to create a new program for each algorithm. Maybe I'll try again in the future
